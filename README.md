# Embedded Systems Robot 

#### The robot made in this project is equipped with sensors allowing it to easily move around obstables, accept and display input commands to trough a keyboard to switch trough 2 different modes of environment data collecting, display it's current speed and more! It was made during my INF1900 course project as a team of 4 people.
### Unfortunatly due to school restrictions, we can't make the code public. The goal of this repository is to give an idea of the project.
