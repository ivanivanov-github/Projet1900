# Embedded Systems Robot 

#### The robot made in this project is equipped with sensors allowing it to easily move around obstables, accept and display input commands to trough a keyboard to switch trough 2 different modes of environment data collecting, display it's current speed and more! It was made during my INF1900 course project as a team of 4 people.
### Unfortunatly due to school restrictions, we can't make the code public. The goal of this repository is to give an idea of the project.

#### The purpose of this project is to learn and practice concepts related to:
> - Makefiles
> - 8-bit Atmel Microcontroller
> - RS232 communication
> - C and linux commands
> - Team work on git/github
> - Libraries (.lib)

#### I personaly mostly worked on the logic allowing the robot to execute the proper command in response to the data acquired by its sensors.
